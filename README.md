## Installation

N/A, app is available live through Netlify

## Usage

This app uses React for all of its framework, and on the contact page where the user can send their name, email, and a message for me, I use a node package called emailJs, that makes it possible to directly send me an email through front-end that saved me the hassel of building a database. For most of the components throughout the site, I used MUI Material Components and Icons.
